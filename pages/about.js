      <p>I am Ian Wilson, a full stack developer that runs and enjoys music.</p>
      <p>
        I enjoy programming topics like JavaScript, Rust, ReasonML and GraphQL. I've
        written some articles about these which can be viewed on my profile at
        https://dev.to/iwilsonq or here on this website.

        In the near future, I would like to get into making educational video
        content as well.
